                    The FreeStyle Libre flash glucose monitoring system and the FreeStyle LibreLink app (“App”), when used with the FreeStyle Libre sensor, are indicated for measuring interstitial fluid glucose levels in adults aged 18 years and older with diabetes mellitus.
                    If you are using the FreeStyle LibreLink app, you must also have access to a blood glucose monitoring system as the App does not provide one. Always read and follow the label/insert for detailed instructions and indication of use.
                    *The FreeStyle LibreLink app and the FreeStyle Libre reader have similar but not identical features. A finger prick test using a blood glucose meter is required during times of rapidly changing glucose levels when interstitial fluid
                    glucose levels may not accurately reflect blood glucose levels or if hypoglycaemia or impending hypoglycaemia is reported by the FreeStyle LibreLink app or when symptoms do not match app re3adings. The FreeStyle Libre sensor communicates
                    with the FreeStyle Libre reader that started it or the FreeStyle LibreLink app that started it. A sensor started by the FreeStyle Libre reader will also communicate with the FreeStyle LibreLink app. The FreeStyle LibreLink app is compatible
                    with NFC enabled smartphones funning Android OS 5.0 or later and iPhone 7 and later running OS 11 and later. Use of FreeStyle LibreLink requires registration with LibreView, a service provided by Abbott and Newyu, Inc. Scanning the
                    sensor does not require lancets. 60-minute warm-up required when applying the sensor. Sensor is water-resistant in up to 1 meter (3 feet) of water. No not immerse longer than 30 minutes. Not to be used above 10,000 feet.
